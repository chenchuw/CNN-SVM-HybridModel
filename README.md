## Reasoning
Recognizing the cell identity is usually through slow and costly sequencing-based methods. Image-based methods for cell identification are cost-efficient and fast, but usually difficult to realize by relating the 2D shape information to identity. By applying the machine learning methods, we could extract features more efficiently and improve the image-based methods classification precision. 

## Introduction
In recent year, machine learning techniques are widely implemented to solve the
image classification problems. In this project, we implemented a hybrid model,
CNN-SVM, where CNN plays the role of feature extractor which can learn from
the data set, and SVM plays the role of a generalized classifier. We showed that
our hybrid model improved the classification accuracy compared to each method
separately. To benchmark our model performance, we compared the accuracy on
classical MNIST data set. And for application, we demonstrated the advanced
accuracy of our model on biological samples to fill the need of precise image-based
methods for cell identification.
